*How Python uses Indentation to control Flow*
	
Python uses Identation to control the flow of your code. What this does to the code is that it affects the
order in which the program that is being build is executed. 

     For example:
	 
	 def addition(a, b):
	     return float(a) + float(b)
			
This code example shows the definition of addition returning the basic function of A + B in the following line.
Indenting the code creates blocks, this is how Python programs gain a structure. Each indentation is a block and
a different place when the code is executed.
