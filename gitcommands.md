 **Git Commands and Terminology** 

   **Repository

   *Repository* by definition is a place or object where things are stored. What a git repository is; is a file locationwhere you can store all of the files that relate to a current project. There are series of commands that can manage and organize this *repository*, but to create a git repository the following code is used;

      git init [project-name] 

The above command is used for creating a local respository on your machine with a specified name. 

   **Clone**

   *Clone* is a copy of the project that is in the respository that you can edit on your local machine. In order to use clone a URL is required from GitHub linking to a respository. An example of a url needed would be similar to this: https://github.com/Wve-program/Mini-Project01.git. Using git commands in order to copy the project and its entire current version would be:

     $ git clone https://github.com/Wve-program/Mini-Project01.git 

This code allows the user to create a clone of the project directly from the respository.
