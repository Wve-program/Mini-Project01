# VI Definition

VI is the Unix Visual Editor. This allows you to edit text files in a full-screen view, within a Unix shell. 

* For basic usage of VI, a user should complete the following:

1) Navigate to the directory of the text file you would like to edit.
2) Enter the command "vi" followed by the filename: "vi filename.txt".
3) Press the "i" key to enter Insert mode. 
4) Add or edit text as intended. 
5) Press the Esc button to leave Insert mode, and return to command mode. 
6) Save and exit changes by typing ":wq" -- that stands for write & quit!

There are some additional commands available as a user gains deeper understanding of VI. A great resource can be found [here](https://staff.washington.edu/rells/R110/)
