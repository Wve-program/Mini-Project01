# Linux Commands

In order to navigate through Linux, a user must be familiar with a few basic commands to get around.

*cd
The CD command allows users to *Change Directory*.
This allows to adjust file path for visibility and management of contents. ◦Example: cd fakepath/fake-sub-directory

* mkdir
Mkdir is used to create a directory, or a new folder to host contents
Completed by navigating to your target location, mkdir newfolder.

* cp
Copy is used to copy a file or directory to a new location.
Example: cp file1.txt target/folder _or_ cp * target/folder (to copy all)

* pwd (Print Working Directory)
Prints the entire directory that you are currently working within. ◦Example: /bin/pwd

* mv
Move OR Rename
Moves files from one directory to another; or rename a file to a new title.
Move Example: mv desired_path/file target_path/sub folder
Rename Example: mv file1.txt file1_new.txt


*rm 
Remove allows users to delete files or folders.
Example: rm -r filename.txt

*History
The *History* command hows a log of all commands performed in the Unix shell.
Completed by typing “history” into the shell and pressing Enter.

* Home directory and ~
The *Home Directory* is the filepath the storage location that hosts a user’s personal files, folders, and executable programs. The tilde (~) can be used to reference the home directory.
Example: “cd ~” can take a user back to their home directory.

*File paths in linux
File paths represent a file or folder’s location within a Linux interface.
Users may navigate through different file paths by using the “cd” command to change
directories, both upstream and downstream.

*Using the tab key to complete file paths
Users may utilize the “tab” key to autocomplete a file path.
For example - if you have a file named Brandon.jpg, you can navigate to the directory where the file is stored and type “br” before pressing the Tab key. Autocomplete will fill in the remainder of “Brandon.jpg” for you.

* Using up and down arrow for history
Users may utilize the up and down arrow keys on their keyboard to cycle through previously used commands.
This allows ease of access for repetitive commands, as the user can pre-fill the command line with a previous command from the shell’s history.
