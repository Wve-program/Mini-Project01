While the workflow diagram doesn't add additional concepts or commands it instead utilizes git commands, but it assigns roles to the different branches that are availible in the project. 

Think of gitflow as a way of looking at the work of a project from a overhead point of view in detail laid before you. Whenever you make a change or merge, it will illustrate the work right before. This is a great way to indentify and coordinate with other collaborators bringing everyone on to the same page. 

There are a few terms and commands everyone should know if they truly want to utilize git.
